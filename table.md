# Data Sources and Their Descriptions

| Data Source | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| GRACE | Total Water Storage (TWS) | Helps evaluate changes in terrestrial TWS by integrating snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater storage |
| FLUXNET | Evaporation, Carbon Dioxide, and other related fluxes | The data includes hourly or sub-hourly flux measurements from various biome types |
| FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) | Various agricultural data | Provides data on agricultural resources worldwide, including information on land use, production, trade, food security, and irrigation. FAOSTAT includes estimates of irrigated area by agricultural census data |
| National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) | Ecological data | Collects standardized ecological data across the United States |
| ISIMIP2b framework | Water demand | Provides input data for water demand modeling |
| ISIMIP2b framework | Water consumption | Provides input data for water consumption modeling |
| International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) | In situ soil moisture data | Collects soil moisture from over 2,800 stations worldwide, providing valuable ground-truth measurements |
| GEMStat | Water quality (surface and groundwater) | The UNEP Water Quality Monitoring System for global water quality assessment |
| Regional-scale agricultural sensor measurements | Multi-channel data of chemical transport models | Includes specific set of parameters to define the variability of land-based chemical processes and potential ways to capture them |
| Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) | Interdisciplinary Scientific Observation and Research | Focuses on understanding the critical zone, the Earth's surface from the top of the vegetation to the bottom of the groundwater |
| Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) | Biogeochemical Cycling | Studies how biogeochemical cycles (e.g., carbon, nutrients) are affected by the critical zone |
| Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) | Terrestrial ecosystem data | Collects data on Australia's terrestrial ecosystems |
| TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories) | In situ soil moisture data | Collects in situ soil moisture data from various sites across Germany |
| TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories) | Surface energy fluxes and carbon fluxes | Monitors energy and carbon exchange between the land surface and atmosphere |
| Lidar Data | Forest Canopy Structure | Used for quantifying forest canopy structure and yielding insights into forest ecosystems |
